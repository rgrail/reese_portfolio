#  Reese's Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my personal analytics portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects where I explore both **personal** and **business-related problems** using data.

##  About

This portfolio highlights my passion for solving real-world problems through data. It includes:

- Business analytics projects involving data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- Personal interest projects inspired by daily life and curiosity
- Tools used: Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Github, and more

Each project includes:
- A clear problem statement
- The tools and techniques used
- Insights and takeaways
- Visuals and/or dashboards where applicable

##  Projects

##  Purpose

This portfolio is both a reflection of my learning journey and a demonstration of my ability to apply data analytics in various contexts. Whether it's optimizing a business process or uncovering insights from personal data, I enjoy working with data, finding insights, and seeing what other realizations I can discover.

Working with data is fun for me, it is one of my personal hobbies. This will be a space where I can keep track of the things I have done!
