## 💡 Purpose

This portfolio is both a reflection of my learning journey and a demonstration of my ability to apply data analytics in various contexts. Whether it's optimizing a business process or uncovering insights from personal data, I enjoy turning numbers into narratives.

Working with data is also fun for me, it is one of my personal hobbies. This will be a space where I can keep track of the things I have done!
